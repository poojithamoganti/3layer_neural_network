# 3layer_neural_network
Using a three layer neural network to classify the two sets of 3-D data set.

Use Sigmiod function and derivte of it.

Generating 50 samples for each data set based on the following criteria:

For Data set 1: Generated randomly a set of data set in three dimensions x1 x2, and x3. The data set has -0.5 <= x1 <= 0.5 ,  -0.5 <= x2 <= 0.5 , and x3=1

For Data set 2: Generated randomly a set of data where x1 and x2  are  between two circles with radius of  3 and 4 having the center as the coordinate, and x3=1
Take 25 negative and 25 positive datasets using math.sqrt(r - (x1_2)**2) formula. 

Plot your initial and final data sets with different color markers.

Plot error function as well.

You should try your experience with different number of nodes in the first and second layer and then choose the network with the minimum number of nodes!

Do not transfer your dataset to a new dimension!
